      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to being
        transparent about how we collect, use, and share information about you.
      </p>
      <p>We will NEVER sell your personal data to anyone.</p>
      <p>
        We treat customer information on our website with the utmost
        confidentiality. We never sell personal data, and we carry out all
        processing operations in strict compliance with applicable laws.
      </p>

      <h2>Definition of Personal Data</h2>
      <p>
        For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, personal data means any
        information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An
        identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
        indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
        identification number, location data, or an online identifier (the
        “Personal Data”).
      </p>

      <h2>Responsibility for Processing Personal Data</h2>
      <p>
        DriveSmart bears responsibility for lawfully processing your data as
        carried out on our site.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Personal Data Processed and Purposes</h2>

      <h3>Usage Data</h3>
      <p>
        When you visit our site, we store the name of your internet service
        provider, the website from which you visited us, HTTP referrers, the
        parts of our site you visit, the date and duration of your visit, and
        information from the device (device type, operating system, screen
        resolution, language, country, and web browser type) you used during
        your visit, URLs of referring/exit pages, and your IP address. We use
        your IP address and/or country preference to approximate your location
        to provide you with a better service experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        We process this usage data to facilitate your access to our services
        (e.g., to adjust our services to the device you are using) and to
        recognize and stop any misuse. We also process usage data in an
        anonymized form for statistical purposes and to improve our site.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect, use, and share aggregated data such as statistical or
        demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated data may be derived from
        your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this
        data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example,
        we may aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users
        accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect
        aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or
        indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data
        which will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The legal basis for this processing is your consent and our legitimate
        interests, such as monitoring and improving our website and services.
      </p>

      <h3>Contacting Us</h3>
      <p>
        When you contact us via our site, for example via the contact form or
        online chat, we ask you for your contact information (e.g., name, email
        address), a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and any other
        documentation, screenshots, or information that would be helpful in
        resolving the issue. We use this data in connection with answering the
        queries we receive.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you receive emails from us, we may use certain analytics tools to
        capture data such as when you open our email or click on any links or
        banners our email contains. This data helps us gauge the effectiveness
        of our communications and marketing campaigns.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also request a personalized demo to discover all features and
        possibilities of our service. In that case, we ask you for your contact
        information such as name, email, and company name. We use this data in
        connection with responding to your demo requests. Through the demo, you
        may also share with us your personal information that we may use during
        the demo and later for the purpose of improving our services and for
        other marketing purposes.
      </p>

      <h3>Information from Other Sources</h3>
      <p>
        We receive information about you and your activities on and off
        DriveSmart from third-party partners, such as advertising and market
        research partners who provide us with information about your interest
        in, and engagement with, our services and online advertisements.
      </p>

      <h3>Access and Disclosure to Third Parties</h3>
      <p>
        We use a select number of trusted external service providers for certain
        technical data analysis, processing, and/or storage. For example, we use
        a variety of third-party services to help operate our services, such as
        hosting our blog and websites, or to help us understand the use of our
        services, such as Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager. We may share
        your personal data with such service providers subject to obligations
        consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate
        confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the
        third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and
        pursuant to our instructions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also disclose your data to any member of our group of companies
        (this means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company, and all its
        subsidiaries) insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes, and on
        the legal bases, set out in this policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will only pass your data on to third parties without your express
        consent if we are obliged to do so by statutory law or an instruction by
        the court.
      </p>

      <h3>Communications</h3>
      <p>
        We may occasionally send you notification emails about updates to our
        product, legal documents, customer support, or marketing emails. Except
        for cases where we are required to do so by law (e.g., notifying you of
        a data breach), you shall have the opportunity to unsubscribe from
        receiving these messages free of charge.
      </p>

      <h3>SPAM Protection</h3>
      <p>
        Google reCAPTCHA (Google Inc.) analyzes the traffic of this website,
        potentially containing users' personal data, for the purpose of
        filtering it from parts of traffic, messages, and content recognized as
        SPAM.
      </p>

      <h3>Legal Bases for Processing</h3>
      <p>
        We collect and process information about you only where we have legal
        bases for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal bases depend on
        how you use DriveSmart services. This means we collect and use your
        information only where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We need it to provide you with DriveSmart services, including
          operating it, providing customer support and personalized features,
          and protecting the safety and security of our service;
        </li>
        <li>
          It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your
          data protection interests), such as for research and development, to
          market and promote DriveSmart, and to protect our legal rights and
          interests;
        </li>
        <li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</li>
        <li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
      </ul>

        to your request and provide information if we have personal data about
        you through you having made contact with us directly and/or you using

      <p>
        Where you have provided consent, you may withdraw it at any time,
        without affecting the lawfulness of the processing that was carried out
        prior to withdrawing it. Whenever you withdraw consent, you acknowledge
        and accept that this may have a negative influence on the quality of the
        DriveSmart site and/or services. You further agree that DriveSmart shall
        not be held liable with respect to any loss and/or damage to your
